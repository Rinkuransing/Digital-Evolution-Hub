Germany Automobile Electric Power Steering Market by Type
The Germany automobile electric power steering market is primarily segmented into two types: column assist EPS and rack assist EPS. The column assist EPS system uses an electric motor mounted on the steering column to assist the driver in turning the wheel. This type is generally more compact and simpler in design, making it an ideal choice for smaller vehicles where space is limited. The system offers excellent responsiveness, requiring less maintenance than traditional hydraulic systems. Moreover, it helps reduce the overall weight of the vehicle, which contributes to better fuel efficiency. Column assist EPS systems are widely adopted in compact cars and city vehicles in the German market due to their affordability and efficiency, making them highly popular in urban driving conditions where maneuverability is crucial.

The rack assist EPS system, on the other hand, directly assists the driver through the steering rack itself. This type provides more precise handling and is often found in larger, performance-oriented vehicles, as it offers superior feedback and control. The rack assist system is more complex but provides better steering feel, which is highly valued in sports and luxury vehicles. It is becoming increasingly common in mid-sized and high-end passenger cars in Germany, where consumers prioritize a more engaging driving experience. This system also contributes to better fuel efficiency and lower emissions due to its lighter weight compared to hydraulic steering. As the demand for eco-friendly vehicles grows, rack assist EPS systems are expected to see continued growth in the German automobile market, particularly among premium and electric vehicle models.
